Program to simulate site frequency spectra using transition matrix methods.   

This program uses pre-computed tables for allele frequency vectors that have been generated by for DFE-alpha to accelerate computations. 
 
Go here to download the tables: http://www.homepages.ed.ac.uk/pkeightl//dfe_alpha/dfe-alpha-download.html.   

A directory_config.dat text file specifying the directory of these tables is required.
